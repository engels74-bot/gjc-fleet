# ci-fixer-caps-backoff.test.sh — B-3 proof for the fix-until-green poller's PURE guardrail
# logic (ci-fixer.sh), driven with a mocked ledger + stubbed ci_state / gh / runner / embed.
# No network, no live PR, no real coding-engine run: the poller is sourced (CI_FIXER_NO_MAIN=1)
# and consider_pr() is called directly per case. Covers exactly what CAN be tested offline:
#
#   (a) RED under caps + enough backoff elapsed -> would-launch (records BOTH #try keys, one run)
#   (b) per-sha cap reached                     -> terminal give-up, taken EXACTLY ONCE (dedup)
#   (c) backoff not elapsed                     -> skip (no new attempt, no run)
#   (d) GREEN / PENDING                          -> zero fixer records, no run
#   (e) per-repo lock busy                       -> deferred (no attempt, no run)
#
# The live termination proofs (a real trivially-fixable RED going green; a real unfixable RED
# walking the backoff/caps to a single escalation; a real concurrent-launch deferral) are
# DEPLOY-phase — see docs/40's runbook — and are deliberately NOT faked here.
